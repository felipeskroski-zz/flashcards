## Flashcards: A mobile app for the popular learning tool
A flashcard is a card bearing information used in classroom drills or in private study. One writes a question on a card and an answer overleaf. Flashcards can bear vocabulary, historical dates, formulas or any subject matter that can be learned via a question-and-answer format. Flashcards are widely used as a learning drill to aid memorisation by way of spaced repetition.
